\noindent \emph{This work aims the disease of malaria at the global, national and regional levels, pointing out the characteristics of the mode of transmission, vectors and symptoms, in addition to mentioning the early diagnosis using microscopic images to then apply effective treatment. In this context, the work presents the following solution: through Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision, a model was developed, based on the YOLO architecture, capable of facilitating the process of microscopic diagnosis of malaria carried out by health professionals. The results obtained were finally evaluated, taking into account which models achieved better performance metrics in relation to the computational cost of space and time, showing that the algorithm is viable for the problem raised.}
